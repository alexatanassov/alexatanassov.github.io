## Summary
M.S. Electrical Engineering student at UC San Diego focused on robotics, perception, and ML. Experienced in Python/C++, ROS2/Gazebo, semantic segmentation, and deployment-minded ML workflows.

## Highlights
- Robotics software: ROS2 nodes, Gazebo simulation, mapping/planning/control integration
- Planning & control: A*, pure pursuit + PID, evaluation and benchmarking
- Perception / CV: segmentation models (U-Net / ResNet-UNet / transformer benchmarks)
- ML systems: PyTorch training pipelines, metrics (IoU/Dice), reproducible experiments
- Deployment: ONNX export, profiling, optimization mindset (latency/memory)
